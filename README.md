#DISCRIPTION:
The given C++ program is a mini arithmetic expression evaluator, often referred to as a **recursive descent parser**. It reads and processes arithmetic expressions provided by the user—such as `"3 + 4 * (2 - 1)"`—and calculates the result following the correct order of operations (also called *operator precedence*). This program uses object-oriented programming principles and recursive functions to break down and evaluate expressions. Let us now explore the structure and working of this code in essay format.

---

At the heart of the program is the `Parser` class, which handles the interpretation and evaluation of arithmetic expressions. The parser works by recursively dividing the expression into manageable components: numbers, operators, and sub-expressions enclosed within parentheses. It follows the standard mathematical rules for evaluation: parentheses take the highest precedence, followed by multiplication and division, and finally addition and subtraction.

The class contains two private data members: a `string input`, which stores the expression, and an `int pos`, which keeps track of the current character position within the expression. The `peek()` method is used to look at the current character without moving the position forward, whereas the `get()` method returns the current character and advances the position. This allows the parser to sequentially read and consume characters from the expression.

One essential method is `skipWhitespace()`, which ignores any spaces in the input. This ensures that expressions like `"3 + 4"` are treated the same as `"3+4"`.

The core of the parsing logic lies in three methods: `parseFactor()`, `parseTerm()`, and `parseExpression()`. These correspond to different levels of precedence in arithmetic expressions.

The `parseFactor()` method handles the most basic units: numbers and sub-expressions inside parentheses. If it detects a `'('`, it recursively calls `parseExpression()` to evaluate the expression inside the parentheses, ensuring that the expression is valid and properly enclosed with a matching `')'`. If it doesn’t find a parenthesis, it then tries to read a number by checking if the current character is a digit or a decimal point. If no valid number is found, it throws a runtime error indicating a syntax issue in the input.

The `parseTerm()` method deals with multiplication and division. It first calls `parseFactor()` to evaluate the first operand and then checks if the next character is either a `'*'` or `'/'`. If it finds such an operator, it consumes it and evaluates the next factor. The result is updated accordingly. This method ensures that all multiplication and division operations are performed before any additions or subtractions.

The `parseExpression()` method sits at the top of the hierarchy. It is responsible for handling addition and subtraction. It starts by evaluating a term, then checks if the next character is a `'+'` or `'-'`. If so, it processes the subsequent term and adjusts the result accordingly.

Once the parser is set up, the `evaluate()` method is used to initialize the parser with the input expression and start parsing from the top using `parseExpression()`.

The `main()` function acts as the user interface. It displays a welcome message, prompts the user to enter an expression, and reads the input using `getline()`. It then calls the parser's `evaluate()` method to compute the result. If the expression is valid, it prints the result. If there is an error in syntax, it catches the exception and prints an appropriate error message.

---

In summary, this C++ program showcases a clean and well-structured implementation of a basic arithmetic expression evaluator. It correctly handles operator precedence and parentheses using recursive methods and throws informative errors when invalid expressions are encountered. Such programs form the foundation for more advanced expression parsers and compilers, making this a valuable educational example of recursive descent parsing and expression evaluation in programming.
